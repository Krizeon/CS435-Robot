# CS435 Embedded Systems Final Project: Two-wheel Drive WiFi Controlled Robot with Autonomous Capabilities
By Kevin Hernandez and Dylan Montagu


## Introduction

For our final project in our Embedded System's course, we were given the task of building a "hands-on, creative learning experience" - very much an opened ended assignment! The only restraint was that our project had to be unique (not copied directly from the web), and demonstrate the various skills and understandings of embedded systems we'd learned ove rthe course of the semester. The tools at our disposal were the Adafruit Circuit Playground (an Arduino compatible microcontroller built on top of the ATmega32u4 Processor), the Adafruit HUZZAH32 (Arduino and MicroPython compatible microcontroller built on top of the ESP32 dual-core chip, with WiFi capabilities), as well as all the code we had written throughout the semester. 

We both agreed that we wanted to create some sort of wheeled robot - how could you not? It's the classic embedded systems project. However, we wanted to provide functionality above the typical base-line "programmed path" project. Continuing along that train of thought, we decided that we wnated to implement the ability to control the robot over WiFi, as well as creating an autonomous mode. With our features decided, the board that we would use was decided for us - the ESP32. 

In figuring out what hardware we would need to create this project, we explored many of the 'robot packages' sold on Adafruit's website. As we were working on a budget, we had to determine what peripherals did we absolutely need to buy and what we could create on our own. We ultimately decided that non-electornic items such as chasis
