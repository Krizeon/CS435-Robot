# Determining a project
For our final project in our Embedded System's course, we were given the task of building a "hands-on, creative learning experience" - very much an opened ended assignment! The only restraint was that our project had to be unique, and not just copied code found online. The tools at our disposal were the Adafruit Circuit Playground (an Arduino compatible microcontroller built on top of the ATmega32u4 Processor), the Adafruit HUZZAH32 (Arduino and MicroPython compatible microcontroller built on top of the ESP32 dual-core chip, with WiFi capabilities), as well as all the code we had written throughout the semester. 

We both agreed that we wanted to create some sort of wheeled robot - how could you not? It's the classic embedded systems project. However, we wanted to provide functionality above the typical base-line "programmed path" project. The initial
